Room Dimensions and Rug Size:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong>Proportional Fit:<\/strong> Ensure the rug is proportional to the size of the room. A large Afghan rug should leave enough space around the edges of the room, typically 12 to 18 inches of bare floor, to create a balanced look.<\/li><li><strong>Furniture Placement:<\/strong> Consider how the rug will fit under and around your furniture. The rug should be large enough to accommodate the main pieces of furniture, such as sofas and coffee tables, without overwhelming the space.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>2. Style and Design:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong>Complementary Patterns:<\/strong> Choose a rug design that complements your existing decor.
